# Linux Driver Source for net/wireless

Extracted from Linux 6.14.4 for VaelixOS hardware support.
These files serve as reference for implementing Rust shims.

## Purpose
This directory contains the Linux driver code that will be used as reference
for implementing the corresponding Rust hardware abstraction layer in VaelixOS.

## Integration Process
1. Study the driver implementation
2. Identify key hardware interaction points
3. Create corresponding Rust interfaces
4. Implement minimal shims for required functionality

## Hardware Details
Realtek RTL8852BE PCIe 802.11ax\n- 2.5 GT/s PCIe\n- 802.11ax support
