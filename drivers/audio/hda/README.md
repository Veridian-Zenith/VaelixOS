# Linux Driver Source for audio/hda

Extracted from Linux 6.14.4 for VaelixOS hardware support.
These files serve as reference for implementing Rust shims.

## Purpose
This directory contains the Linux driver code that will be used as reference
for implementing the corresponding Rust hardware abstraction layer in VaelixOS.

## Integration Process
1. Study the driver implementation
2. Identify key hardware interaction points
3. Create corresponding Rust interfaces
4. Implement minimal shims for required functionality

## Hardware Details
Intel Alder Lake PCH-P HD Audio\n- Device ID: 8086:51c8\n- SOF audio support
