## Introduction

VaelixOS is a next-generation modular operating system designed to eliminate technical debt from legacy OS structures while ensuring full customization, modern security, and bleeding-edge performance.

## Getting Started

To get started with VaelixOS, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vaelixos.git
   cd vaelixos
   ```

2. **Build the Project**
   ```sh
   cargo build
   ```

3. **Run the Project**
   ```sh
   cargo run
   ```

## Architecture

VaelixOS is built with a modular architecture that includes the following components:

- **Kernel (VaelixCore)**: Rust-based microkernel with a hardened security model.
- **Graphics System (VegaGX)**: Custom windowing system with a layered compositor.
- **User Interface Layer (VXUI)**: Rust-based GUI framework for modular applications.
- **Package Management (VXP)**: Performance-optimized package resolution system.
- **Networking System (VXNet)**: Rust-native TCP/IP stack with security-first defaults.
